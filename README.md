# Project definition

## Background
I am currently doing my master's in computer science at UdeM in the bioinformatics stream. For my master's I will be looking at rare genetic variants (CNVs, SNPs), functional connectivity, methods for dimensionality reduction of fMRI data so I would like to create a brainhack school project that allows me to learn some of the tools I'll need. I am very interested in the extent of variation in human brains and how we can explore the differences in mind with the tools we have to measure brain structure and connectivity.

## Tools
I would like to learn these tools (and more) through the project:
 * Docker
 * nilearn
 * Compute canada servers
 * git/github
 * data visualization tools

## Data
I would like to work with data from the UK bio bank.
<!-- test comment -->

## Deliverables
I would like to produce a docker container, jupyter notebooks, an interactive data visualization, and a script for running jobs on compute canada servers.
