# Project definition

## Background
I am currently doing my master's in computer science at UdeM in the bioinformatics stream. For my master's I will be looking at rare genetic variants (CNVs, SNPs), functional connectivity, methods for dimensionality reduction of fMRI data so I would like to create a brainhack school project that allows me to learn some of the tools I'll need. 
<!-- I am very interested in the extent of variation in human brains and if there is a continuous expression from "healthy" to "pathological" brains.
I want to explore the variation in brains by looking at fMRI data from the UK bio bank:
1. Take a pathology linked to neuroticism (psychosis, schizophrenia?) (big five personality traits) that can be robustly predicted from fmri
2. compare with healthy brains with ranging levels of neuroticism to see if there is a range in connectivity patterns from standard to extreme
-->
<!--Use UK bio bank resting state fMRI data for alcoholics and non-alcoholics and see if alcoholics can be accurately predicted, see if can include genetic component -->

## Tools
I would like to learn these tools through the project:
 * Docker
 * nilearn
 * Compute canada servers
 * git/github
 * data visualization tools

## Data
I would like to work with data from the UK bio bank.

## Deliverables
I would like to produce a docker container, jupyter notebooks, an interactive data visualization, and a script for running jobs on compute canada servers.
