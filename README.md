# Project definition

## Background
I am currently doing my master's in computer science at UdeM in the bioinformatics stream. I'm pretty comfortable with a lot of coding and machine learning/deep learning, but I am totally new to neuroscience and the biology side of things and am very excited to learn. For my master's I will (most likely) be looking at rare genetic variants (CNVs, SNPs), functional connectivity, methods for dimensionality reduction of fMRI data so I would like to create a brainhack school project that allows me to learn some of the tools I'll need. I am very interested in the extent of variation in human brains and how we can explore the differences in mind with the tools we have to measure brain structure and connectivity.

## Tools
I would like to learn these tools (and more) through the project:
*Docker
*nilearn
*Compute canada servers
*git/github
*data visualization tools
*statistics tools (especially for genetics)

## Data
I would like to work with a dataset on the extent of variation in healthy brains, on addiction, or on mental health that has a genetic component.

## Deliverables
I would like to produce a docker container, jupyter notebooks, an interactive data visualization, and a script for running jobs on compute canada servers.
