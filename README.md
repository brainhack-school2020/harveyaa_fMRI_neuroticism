## Background
I am a currently doing my master's in computer science at UdeM in the bioinformatics stream. I haven't locked down my thesis project yet but it will involve the impact of rare genetic variants on functional connectivity. I did my undergrad in math and have a pretty good basis in coding in python and machine learning, but I am totally new to neuroscience and very excited about brainhack school.

I'm interested in variation in human brains and am curious about neuropsychiatric disorders as extremes of characterestics that are found in the overall population. To explore this idea, I want to look at the human connectome project dataset of 1200 healthy young adults that includes resting state fMRI and personality/behaviour data. Specifically, I want to try and predict neuroticism, one of the big five personality traits that is associated with mental disorders, from fMRI to see if:
1. If there are significant/consistent markers for neuroticism in fMRI data.
2. If so, how do they compare to findings about schizophrenia/anxiety/depression/ADHD in the literature.

<!-- Possibly try to predict other behavioural features-->
<!-- I find trying to predict neuroticism especially interesting because we know that the changes in connectivity due to neuropsychiatric disorders are not specific, so it seems likely that if there is a pattern for neuroticism that it would be similar.-->

## Tools
I plan on using the following tools:
 * compute canada servers with globus and aws s3 for file access and transfer
 * nilearn
 * similarity network fusion
 * sklearn
 * Data visualization

## Data
I will use the HCP 1200 healthy young adult dataset.

## Deliverables
I would like to produce jupyter notebooks with examples of the analysis code, an interactive data visualization, and a script for running jobs on compute canada servers.
