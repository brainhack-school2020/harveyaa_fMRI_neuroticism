## Steps:
1. Access HCP data
2. Do some exploratory analysis with a (tiny) of the data to establish a pipeline
    1. Parcellation resolution? Dynamic parcellation (dypac?)
    2. Connectivity matrices
    3. Features for prediction
    4. ML algorithm for prediction (random forest?)
3. Write scripts to run pipeline on compute canada
4. Analyze results
