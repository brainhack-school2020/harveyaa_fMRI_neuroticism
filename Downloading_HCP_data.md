# Explanation of how we downloaded the data from the Human Connectome Project website

Prior to the download, we registered to [the HCP website](https://db.humanconnectome.org/)
and downloaded Aspera Plugin (it was requested by the website for the download process).

Then, in the main menu we chose the WU-Minn HCP Data -1200 subjects and clicked on “Explore Subjects”, 
so we can choose subjects according to specific filters.

We chose 3T data set, and added a filter according to the subjects’ personality scores. 
We wanted to have subjects who got extreme scores for Neuroticism.

Then, we clicked on the “download image” (on the right side of the screen). 
This will transfer you to a page where you can download the specific package which you requested. 
We then asked for a “Resting State Denoised” – preprocessed data of the specific subjects that we chose. 
After this, we downloaded the package.

Each subject has his own Zip file which you have to extract and only then you can work with the data.
